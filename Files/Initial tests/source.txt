All I did differently was to ask DeepSeek on why I couldn't read/write my files. The result was the following lines:

import os

script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
file_path = os.path.join(script_dir, 'file.txt')

try:
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        # Insert code here
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"The file '{file_path}' was not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f'An error has occurred: {e}')
