1. Core Python Fundamentals
    Topics to Cover:

        Data types (strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets)
            Need to study more lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries

        Control flow (if-else, loops)
            Check

        Functions (defining, calling, parameters, return values)
            Check

        Error handling (try-except blocks)
            Need to study

    Why?:

        These are the building blocks of Python programming. A strong foundation will help you write cleaner and more efficient code.

2. File Handling
    Topics to Cover:

        Reading and writing files (open(), with statement)

        Working with different file modes ('r', 'w', 'a', 'rb', etc.)

        Handling file paths dynamically (os.path, __file__)

    Why?:

        File handling is essential for working with data, logs, and configurations in real-world applications.

3. String Manipulation
    Topics to Cover:

        String methods (split(), join(), strip(), replace(), etc.)
            Need to study more

        Regular expressions (re module)

        Formatting strings (f-strings, str.format(), % formatting)

    Why?:

        Strings are one of the most commonly used data types, and mastering string manipulation is crucial for tasks like data cleaning and text processing.

4. Data Structures and Algorithms
    Topics to Cover:

        Lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples
            Need to study more

        Stacks, queues, and linked lists

        Sorting and searching algorithms

        Recursion and dynamic programming

    Why?:

        Understanding data structures and algorithms will help you write efficient and scalable code.

5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    Topics to Cover:

        Classes and objects

        Inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism

        Magic methods (__init__, __str__, etc.)

    Why?:

        OOP is a key paradigm in Python and is widely used in building large-scale applications.

6. Working with Libraries and Modules
    Topics to Cover:

        Importing and using standard library modules (os, math, random, datetime, etc.)

        Installing and using third-party libraries (pip, numpy, pandas, etc.)

    Why?:

        Python's extensive library ecosystem is one of its greatest strengths. Learning to use libraries will save you time and effort.

7. Data Processing and Analysis
    Topics to Cover:

        Working with CSV, JSON, and other file formats

        Using pandas for data manipulation

        Basic data visualization with matplotlib or seaborn

    Why?:

        Data processing and analysis are essential skills for working with real-world datasets.

8. Advanced Topics
    Topics to Cover:

        Generators and iterators

        Decorators and context managers

        Multithreading and multiprocessing

        Working with APIs and web scraping

    Why?:

        These topics will help you write more advanced and efficient Python programs.

9. Projects and Practice
    Suggestions:

        Build a small project (e.g., a to-do list app, a weather app, or a file organizer).

        Solve coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codewars.

        Contribute to open-source projects on GitHub.

    Why?:

        Practical experience is the best way to solidify your knowledge and improve your problem-solving skills.
